## Definitions

- "Done" for screens means design created in Figma, URL route created, page designed to match Figma, and core functionality added.
  - It does not mean screen fully QA'd
  - For emails, it means design created in Figma, email created in the BE and designed, and all needed data being populated.
  - For BE jobs, it means job created and core functionality done, and all triggers created and working
- Season starts September 9th, invites should be sent out no later than September 1st
  - Therefore, August should only be used for QA and small polishes if possible
